## ✨ Overview

DescribeX is an open-source AI-powered video captioning platform designed to help creators generate high-quality captions for short-form videos in multiple expressive styles.

Whether you're publishing on YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, or any other platform, DescribeX enables you to generate, edit, and export captions without being locked into a single ecosystem.

Built for the **AMD Developer Hackathon: ACT II**, DescribeX is designed to outlive the competition as a long-term open-source project focused on accessibility and creator ownership.

## 🏗 Project Architecture

DescribeX consists of two primary components.

### 🌐 DescribeX Web

A modern web application where creators can:

- Upload videos
- Generate captions
- Edit captions
- Export captions
- Manage previous caption jobs

### 🧠 DescribeX Engine

A reusable Python-based caption generation engine responsible for:

- Video preprocessing
- Frame extraction
- AI inference
- Caption generation
- Caption formatting

The same engine powers both the web application and the AMD Hackathon Docker submission.
